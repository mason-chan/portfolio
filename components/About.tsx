              Hello! My name is Mason and I am a self taught web developer that
              enjoys building things. Before I embarked on my web development
              journey, I&apos;ve went through several phases from studying art
              üé®, architecture üè´, to mechanical engineering üß∞. I had no
              interest in coding at the time, but I always aimed at creating
              things from my vision through different medias whether it be in
              academic studies or through my hobbies.
            </p>

              I also dabbled in MATLAB during my mechanical engineering degree,
              but it wasn&apos;t until I picked up a particular hobby{" "}
              <span className="text-light ">(Mechanical Keyboards!)</span>, that
              influenced me into learning how to code! I now enjoy creating
              fluid, minimalistic digital works of art with my favorite
              peripheral(s){" "}
