# My Portfolio Website!

## Details

The technologies used to make this website are React v18.2 with TypeScript, Next.js 12.3.1, and TailwindCSS v3.1.8. I've also used Framer-Motion v7.4.0 to create the simple animations for the website, and I used packages including react-simple-typewriter and tailwindcss-scrollbar for additional customization.

Of course I themed my website around my favorite hobby that is custom mechanical keyboards, and had to use some of my favorite keycap color themes:
